    <p1 id="p1">
        Hi, my name is Kray6, that is all you will get for now; in regards to identity.
        I am writing this in hopes that I can inspire someone's life.
        the world as we know it, is changing; whether that is 
        good or bad depends on who you are, or rather who you become.
        
    </p1>
    <p2 id="p2">
        <h3 id="h2">Gods of God("Readers")</h3>
        I shall continue with disclosing a secret; 
        a secret that is as true as existence it's self.
        "if you truly know what it means to love yourself and
        indeed do love yourself" "All will seek to be loved by you"
        <div>  <button id="b2"> Facts!</button></div>
        <div id="2nd" style="visibility: hidden;"><h3>"Loving Thyself is Much More Than Affirmations" </h3></div>
        Loving thyself is not "I Love Me!" 
        Loving thyself is a VERB that consist of consistent actions with the intent 
        of acheiving and progreesing "Health, Wealth, and Happiness" for self and community.
      
    </p2>
    <p3 id="p3">
        <h3 id="h3">Who are you? What are you?</h3>
       <div> <button id="b3"> I'm ready to know </button></div>
       <div id="3rd" style="visibility: hidden;"><h3>Nature formed your body, you are shaped that way  because that is what you needed and were capable creating with all you knew to survive </h3></div>
        I will let you percieve your own definition of
        Who and What you are. I, instead  will disclose what you can do?
        Your, and I mean everyone, superpower is called "Better or Growth."
        it is nothing you can do about it, as long as you are "Breathing  and Competent"
        and if you are reading this than you are both; You will always get better and grow.
        Why is that? Is it because you are God? H3ll no!
        it is beacause you are muade up of intelligentce, your entire genetic being.
        Every cell in your body wants and needs before you do, however, you have the final
        say on satisfying the wants and needs of your inner selves(cells).
        It is a universal Principal that if you are good to yourself,
        then your sevles(Cells) will be good to you.
       
       <h3 id="h4"> "It must be a secrect"</h3> 
       <div><button id="b4"> Tell it!</button></div>
       <div id="4th" style="visibility: hidden;"><h3>Do not run and you shall overcome </h3></div>
        whatever you find difficult immerse yourself in it and do not let up until
        it becomes familair.
        
       <h3 id="h5">"Secret Sauce(ThatSauce) = Believe in yourself."
            Do you have "ThatSauce?"
            Prove It! How?</h3>
           <div><button id="b5">Don't stop now!</button></div>
           <div id="5th" style="visibility: hidden;"><h3>Believe in yourself, you are apart of Greatness and Amazing</h3></div>
        You can PROVE that "You indeed have love for yourself" and that "you truly have 'ThatSauce'"
        by taking advantage of one concept.
        an concept called "24/hrs," and how you spend yours not only sets you apart from the next person,
        it also influences your tommorow, deeply consider that.
        <H3> Why was I Chosen?</H3>
        <div><button id="b6"> Why Me God!</button></div>
        <div id="6th" style="visibility: hidden;"><h3>Who would you perfer it be? Why not you?</h3></div>
        I have a better question, Why do you continue on? you could unchoose at anytime consider that.

        The goal is to grow and become stronger for all life; thier is no other win outside of that.
        Even when you so called lose as long as you learn from it (you always learn somthing) you will grow in some way.
        which is classified as a win.
        lastly what is a "Win" without growth... a loss.
